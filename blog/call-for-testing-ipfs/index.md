Happy new year Ubunteros and Ubunteras!

If you have been following our testing days, you will know by now that
our intention is to get more people contributing to Ubuntu and free
software projects, and to help them getting started through testing
and related tasks. So, we will be making frequent calls for testing
where you can contribute and learn. Educational AND fun ^_^

To start the year, I would like to invite you to test the IPFS
candidate snap. IPFS is a really interesting free project for
distributed storage. You can read more about it and watch a demo in
the [IPFS website](https://ipfs.io/]).

We have pushed a nice snap with their latest stable version to the
candidate channel in the store. But before we publish it to the stable
channel we would like to get more people testing it.

You can get a clean and safe environment to test following some of the
guides you'll find on the
[summaries of the past testing days](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/UbuntuTestingDay).

Or, if you want to use your current system, you can just do:

    $ sudo snap install ipfs --candidate

I have written a
[gist with a simple guide to get started testing it](https://gist.github.com/elopio/7492a28bd1aef6c4a86b5dcf5d5cb65b#smoke-tests-for-the-ipfs-snap)

If you finish that successfully and still have more time, or are
curious about ipfs, please continue with an exploratory testing
session. The idea here is just to execute random commands, try unusual
inputs and just play around.

You can get ideas from the [IPFS docs](https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/).

When you are done, please send me an email with your results and any
comments. And if you get stuck or have any kind of question, please
don't hesitate to ask. Remember that we welcome everybody.
