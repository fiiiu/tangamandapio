> According to this wise man [NordenskiÃ¶ld], the indians placed in their tombs
> only quipus with numbers that for them had a magical value, expressing them
> not in a direct way but through others that included them or their multiples,
> and trying to make them coincide with the resulting numbers of calculations
> from consulting the stars. [...].
> The purpose that lead the indians to such practice was to entertain, with
> this complicated "rebus", the evil spirits, who would struggle to untie the
> knots in the strings and find this magical numbering [...].

And that's how the incas invented the cipher with prime number factorization,
the base of all our secure communications and cryptocurrencies. :D
