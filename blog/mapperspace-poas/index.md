Last Sunday we went to the
[Poás Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%C3%A1s_Volcano)
to make free maps.

This is the second geek outing of the JaquerEspéis. From the first one we
learned that we had to wait until summer because
[it's not possible to make maps during a storm](https://archive.org/download/jaquerespeis-mapas/photo484953803566260.jpg).
And the day was perfect. It wasn't just sunny, but the crater was totally clear
and thus we could add a new spot of Costa Rica to the virtual tour.

In addition to that, this time we arrived much better prepared, with multiple
phones with [mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/),
[osmand](http://osmand.net/) and
[OSMTracker](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMTracker_(Android)), a
[360 cam](https://theta360.com/en/), a
[Garmin GPS](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/140022), a drone and even
[a notebook](https://twitter.com/elotrojames) and two biologists.

Here's how it works. Everybody with the GPS in the phone activated waits until
it finds the location. Then, each person uses the application of his preference
to collect data: pictures, audio, video, text notes,
[traces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_eXchange_Format), annotations in the
notebook...

Later, in our homes, we upload, publish and share all the collected data. These
is useful to improve the free maps of
[OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap). We add from
really simple things like
[the location of a trash bin](https://archive.org/download/maperespeis-poas/20170226_105554.jpg)
to really important things like how accessible is the place for a person in a
wheelchair, together with the location of all the accesses or the places that
have a lack of them. Each person improves the map a little, in the region that
he knows or passed by. With more than 3 million users, OpenStreetMap is the
best map of the world that exists; and it has a particular importance in
regions like ours, without a lot of economic potential for the
[megacorporations that make and sell closed maps stealing private data from their users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil#The_End_of_.22Don.27t_Be_Evil.22).

Because the maps we make are free, what comes next has no limits. There are
groups working on the reconstruction of 3D models from the pictures, on the
identification and interpretation of signs, on applications to calculate the
optimal route to reach any place using any combination of means of
transportation, on applications to assist decission making during the design of
the future of a city, and many other things. All of this based on shared
knowledge and community.

The image above is the virtual tour in
Mapillary. As we recorded it with the 360 cam, you can click and drag with the
mouse to see all the angles. You can also click above, in the play button to
follow the path we took. Or you can click in any of the green dots in the map
to follow your own path.

Thank you very much to everybody who joined us, specially to Denisse and
Charles for being our guides, and for filling up the trip with interesting
information about flora, fauna, geology and historic importance of El Poás.
