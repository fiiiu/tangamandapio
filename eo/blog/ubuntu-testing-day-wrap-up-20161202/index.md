We have survived two testing days, and now we can safely say that it will become
a Friday tradition :)

Last Friday our nice guest was [Aaron Ogle](https://twitter.com/geekgonecrazy),
from [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.chat/). He gave us a tour on the Rocket Chat
UI and we discussed about how they packaged it as a snap.

Building from what we saw on the first session, we tested the snap
using a virtual machine again. But this time, we cloned it to keep a pristine
machine and make following testing sessions faster. If you want to help the
Ubuntu and Rocket Chat communities, this is an easy way to prepare your
environment:

 * [Set up a virtual machine](http://elopio.net/blog/install-ubuntu-in-vm/)
 * [Install Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop)
 * [Clone the pristine virtual machine](http://elopio.net/blog/pristine-vm/)

Once you have your clone ready, install the most recent and bleeding edge
version of rocket chat with:

    $ sudo snap install rocketchat-server --edge

Then you can follow this

Also you can test a real installation of Rocket Chat, joining
[our community channel](https://rocket.ubuntu.com/channel/community), where we
are available all day, every day. If you have a question, just ask. I am elopio
in there.

During the session we took a look at the [GitHub website](https://github.com),
where many free software communities do their development in the open. They have
a great [guide to start contributing to open source projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/). Go on and
spread your love for free software in the form of bug reports :)

The gratitude this week goes to our newly acquired staff members
[Julia](https://twitter.com/la_juyis) and
[Kyle](https://twitter.com/rainveil), and of course to Aaron for letting us
have a funny Friday evening. Make sure to take a look at the cool
things he and his teammates are doing; and if you have some free time and want
to join an exciting, open and nice community, give them a hand. Also try the
Jitsi integration for video conference, it's mind-blowing that there are no
closed components anywhere.

See you next Friday at [Ubuntu On-Air](https://ubuntuonair.com).
