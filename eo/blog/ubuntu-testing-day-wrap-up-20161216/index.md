Today we had the last Ubuntu Testing Day of the year.

We invited [Sergio Schvezov](http://blog.sergiusens.org/) and
[Joe Talbott](https://twitter.com/JoeTalbott), to join
[Kyle](https://twitter.com/rainveil) and myself. Together we have been working
on [Snapcraft](http://snapcraft.io) the whole year.

Sergio did a great introduction of snapcraft, and showed some of the new
features that will land next week in Ubuntu. And because it was the last day of
work for everybody (except Kyle), we threw some beers into the hang out and
made it our team end of year party.

Snapcraft is one of the few projects that have an exception to land new features
into released versions of Ubuntu. So every week we are landing new things in
Xenial and Yakkety. This means that we need to constantly test that we are not
breaking anything for all the people using stable Ubuntu releases; and it means
that we would love to have many more hands helping us with those tests.

If you would like to help, all you have to do is
[set up a virtual machine](http://elopio.net/blog/install-ubuntu-in-vm/) and
[enable the proposed pocket](http://elopio.net/blog/test-sru/) in there.

This is the active bug for the Stable Release Update of snapcraft 2.24:
[bug #1650632](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapcraft/+bug/1650632)

Before I shut down my computer and start my holidays, I would like to thank all
the Ubuntu community for one more year, it has been quite a ride. And I would
like to thank Sergio, Kyle and Joe in particular. They are the best team a QA
Engineer could ask for <3.

See you next year for more testing days.
