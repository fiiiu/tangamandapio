service for the projects hosted on GitHub. With it, you can run tests, deliver
artifacts and deploy applications every time you push a commit, on pull requests, after they are merged, or with some other frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Travis CI
&lt;a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-06-21-trusty-updates-2017-Q2-launch"&gt;updated the Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) machines&lt;/a&gt;
that run your tests and deployment steps. This update came with a nice surprise for everybody
working to deliver software to Linux users, because it is now possible to
install &lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io"&gt;snaps&lt;/a&gt; in Travis!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been excited all week telling people about all the doors that this opens;
but if you have been following my adventures in the Ubuntu world, by now you
can probably guess that I'm mostly thinking about all the potential this has
for automated testing. For the automation of user acceptance tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User acceptance tests are executed from the point of view of the user, with
your software presented as a black box to them. The tests can only interact
with the software through the entry points you define for your users. If it's
a CLI application, then the tests will call commands and subcommands and check
the outputs. If it's a website or a desktop application, the tests will click
things, enter text and check the changes on this GUI. If it's a service with
an HTTP API, the tests will make requests and check the responses. On these
tests, the closer you can get to simulate the environment and behaviour of your
real users, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snaps are great for the automation of user acceptance tests because they are
immutable and they bundle all their dependencies. With this we can make sure
that your snap will work the same on any of the operating systems and
architectures that support snaps. The &lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/snapd"&gt;snapd&lt;/a&gt; service takes care of hiding
the differences and presenting a consistent execution environment for the snap.
So, getting a green execution of these tests in the Trusty machine of Travis is
a pretty good indication that it will work on all the active releases of
Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and even on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about, obviously using my
favourite snap called IPFS. There is
&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/ipfs-crowdtesting/"&gt;more information about IPFS in my previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check below the packaging metadata for the IPFS snap, a single &lt;code&gt;snapcraft.yaml&lt;/code&gt;
file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;versioned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;peer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;peer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;filesystem&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;IPFS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;combines&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ideas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Kademlia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SFS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;single&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bittorrent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;swarm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exchanging&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;objects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IPFS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;provides&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;simple&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;web&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;permanence&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;built&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;You&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;also&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;plugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;parts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/ipfs/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;plugin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;prepare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;../&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/src/github.com/ipfs/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;../&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/src/github.com/ipfs/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;env&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;GOPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)/../&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;../&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/src/github.com/ipfs/g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ipfs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;$SNAPCRAFT_PART_INSTALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="n"&gt;mv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;../&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sr"&gt;/bin/ipfs $SNAPCRAFT_PART_INSTALL/bin/&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;go1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not the most simple snap because they use their own build tool to get the
go dependencies and compile; but it's also not too complex. If you are new to
snaps and want to understand every detail of this file, or you want to package
your own project, the
&lt;a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/create-first-snap"&gt;tutorial to create your first snap&lt;/a&gt;
is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important here is that if you run &lt;code&gt;snapcraft&lt;/code&gt; using the snapcraft.yaml file above, you
will get the IPFS snap. If you install that snap, then you can test it from the
point of view of the user. And if the tests work well, you can push it to the
edge channel of the Ubuntu store to start the crowdtesting with your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can automate all of this with Travis. The &lt;code&gt;snapcraft.yaml&lt;/code&gt; for the project
must be already in the GitHub repository, and we will add there a &lt;code&gt;.travis.yml&lt;/code&gt;
file. They have
&lt;a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/"&gt;good docs to prepare your Travis account&lt;/a&gt;.
First, let's see what's required to build the snap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;snapcore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;snapcraft&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sh&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; snapcraft"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For now, we build the snap in a docker container to keep things simple. We have
work in progress to be able to install snapcraft in Trusty as a snap, so soon
this will be even nicer running everything directly in the Travis machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This previous step will leave the packaged .snap file in the current directory.
So we can install it adding a few more steps to the Travis script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;script:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;- docker [...]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;- sudo apt install --yes snapd&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;- sudo snap install *.snap --dangerous&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And once the snap is installed, we can run it and check that it works as expected.
Those checks are our automated user acceptance test. IPFS has a CLI
client, so we can just run commands and verify outputs with grep. Or we can get
fancier using &lt;a href="https://github.com/kward/shunit2"&gt;shunit2&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats/"&gt;bats&lt;/a&gt;. But the basic idea would be to
add to the Travis script something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="na"&gt;script:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;[...]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;- /snap/bin/ipfs init&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;- /snap/bin/ipfs cat /ipfs/QmVLDAhCY3X9P2uRudKAryuQFPM5zqA3Yij1dY8FpGbL7T/readme | grep -z "^Hello and Welcome to IPFS!.*$"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="na"&gt;- [...]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If one of those checks fail, Travis will mark the execution as failed and stop
our release process until we fix them. If instead, all of the checks pass, then this version
is good enough to put into the store, where people can take it and run
exploratory tests to try to find problems caused by weird scenarios that we
missed in the automation. To help with that we have the
&lt;code&gt;snapcraft enable-ci travis&lt;/code&gt; command, and a tutorial to guide you
step by step
&lt;a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/continuous-snap-delivery-from-travis-ci#0"&gt;setting up the continuous delivery from Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the IPFS snap we had for a long time a manual smoke suite, that our amazing
&lt;a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/call-for-testing-ipfs/97"&gt;community of testers&lt;/a&gt;
have been executing over and over again, every time we want to publish a new
release. I've turned it into
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap/blob/master/tests/smoke_test.sh"&gt;a simple bash script&lt;/a&gt;
that from now on will be executed frequently by Travis, and will tell us if
there's something wrong before anybody gives it a try manually. With this our
community of testers will have more time to run new and interesting scenarios,
trying to break the application in clever ways, instead of running the same
repetitive steps many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Travis and snapcraft we no longer have to worry about a big part of
or release process. Continuous integration and delivery can be fully automated,
and we will have to take a look only when something breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for IPFS, it will keep being my guinea pig to guide new features for
snapcraft and showcase them when ready. It has many more commands that
have to be added to the automated test suite, and it also has a web UI and
an HTTP API. Lots of things to play with! If you would like to help, and
on the way learn about snaps, automation and the decentralized web, please
let me know. You can take a look on my
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap"&gt;IPFS snap repo&lt;/a&gt; for more details about
testing snaps in Travis, and other tricks for the build and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

We want developers to release their software to any Linux distro in a way
that's safe, simple and flexible. You can read more about this at
&lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io/"&gt;snapcraft.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is extremely fun because we have to work constantly with a wild
variety of free software projects to make sure that the tools we write are
usable and that the workflow we are proposing makes sense to developers and
gives them a lot of value in return. Today I want to talk about one of those
projects: IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPFS is the permanent and decentralized web. How cool is that? You get a
peer-to-peer distributed file system where you store and retrieve files. They
have a nice demo &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/"&gt;in their website&lt;/a&gt;, and you can give it a
try on Ubuntu Trusty, Xenial or later by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo snap install ipfs
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/ipfs-peers.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of the IPFS peers" src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/ipfs-peers.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's one of the problems we are trying to solve. We have millions of users
on the Trusty version of Ubuntu, released during 2014. We also have millions of
users on the Xenial version, released during 2016. Those two versions are stable
now, and following the Ubuntu policies, they will get only security updates for
5 years. That means that it's very hard, almost impossible, for a young project
like IPFS to get into the Ubuntu archives for those releases. There will be no
simple way for all those users to enjoy IPFS, they would have to use a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Package_Archive"&gt;Personal Package Archive&lt;/a&gt;
or install the software from a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)"&gt;tarball&lt;/a&gt;. Both methods are
complex with high security risks, and both require the users to put a lot of
trust on the developers, more than what they should ever trust anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are closing the Zesty release cycle which will go out in April, so it's
too late there too. IPFS could make a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)"&gt;deb&lt;/a&gt;, put it into Debian,
wait for it to sync to Ubuntu, and then it's likely that it will be ready for
the October release. Aside from the fact that we have to wait until October,
there are a few other problems. First, making a deb is not simple. It's not
too hard either, but it requires quite some time to learn to do it right.
Second, I mentioned that IPFS is young, they are on the 0.4.6 version. So, it's
very unlikely that they will want to support this early version for such a long
time as Debian and Ubuntu require. And they are not only young, they are also
fast. They add new features and bug fixes every day and make new releases almost
every week, so they need a feedback loop that's just as fast. A 6 months release
cycle is way too slow. That works nicely for some kinds of free software
projects, but not for one like IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been kind enough to let me play with their project and use it as a
test subject to verify our end-to-end workflow. My passion is testing, so I have
been focusing on continuous delivery to get happy early adopters and constant
feedback about the most recent changes in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by making a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap/blob/master/snapcraft.yaml"&gt;snapcraft.yaml&lt;/a&gt;
file that contains all the metadata required for the snap package. The file is
pretty simple and to make the first version it took me just a couple of minutes,
true story. Since then I've been slowly improving and updating it with small
changes. If you are interested in doing the same for your project, you can read
&lt;a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/create-first-snap"&gt;the tutorial to create a snap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built and tested this snap locally on my machines. It worked nicely, so I
pushed it to the edge channel of the Ubuntu Store. Here, the snap is not visible
on user searches, only the people who know about the snap will be able to
install it. I told a couple of my friends to give it a try, and they came back
telling me how cool IPFS was. Great choice for my first test subject, no
doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, following the pace of the project by manually building and
pushing new versions to the store was too demanding, they go too fast. So, I
started working on continuous delivery by translating everything I did manually
into scripts and hooking them to travis-ci. After a few days, it got pretty
fancy, take a look at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/elopio/ipfs-snap"&gt;the github repo of the IPFS snap&lt;/a&gt; if you
are curious. Every day, a new version is packaged from the latest state of the
master branch of IPFS and it is pushed to the edge channel, so we have a constant
flow of new releases for hardcore early adopters. After they install IPFS from
the edge channel once, the package will be automatically updated in their
machines every day, so they don't have to do anything else, just use IPFS as
they normally would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with this constant stream of updates, me and my two friends were not enough
to validate all the new features. We could never be sure if the project was
stable enough to be pushed to the stable channel and make it available to the
millions and millions of Ubuntu users out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the Ubuntu community is huge, and they are very nice people. It was
time to use the wisdom of the crowds. I invited the most brave of them to keep
the snap installed from edge and I defined a simple pipeline that leads to the
stable release using the four available channels in the Ubuntu store:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a revision is tagged in the IPFS master repo, it is automatically pushed
   to edge channel from travis, just as with any other revision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis notifies me about this revision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I install this tagged revision from edge, and run a super quick test to make
   sure that the IPFS server starts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it starts, I push the snap to the beta channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a couple of my friends, we run a
   &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/elopio/7492a28bd1aef6c4a86b5dcf5d5cb65b#file-ipfs-smoke-tests-md"&gt;suite of smoke tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If everything goes well, I push the snap to the candidate channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I notify the community of Ubuntu testers about a new version in the candidate
   channel. This is were the magic of crowd testing happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ubuntu testers run the smoke tests in all their machines, which gives us
   the confidence we need because we are confirming that the new version works
   on different platforms, distros, distro releases, countries, network
   topologies, you name it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This candidate release is left for some time in this channel, to let the
   community run thorough exploratory tests, trying to find weird usage
   combinations that could break the software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the tag was for a final upstream release, the community also runs
   &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/elopio/7492a28bd1aef6c4a86b5dcf5d5cb65b#file-ipfs-update-tests-md"&gt;update tests&lt;/a&gt;
   to make sure that the users with the stable snap installed will get this new
   version without issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After all the problems found by the community have been resolved or at least
   acknowledged and triaged as not blockers, I move the snap from candidate
   to the stable channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the users following the stable channel will automatically get a very well
   tested version, thanks to the community who contributed with the testing and
   accepted a higher level of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we start again, the never-ending cycle of making free software :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's go back to the discussion about trust. Debian and Ubuntu, and most of
the other distros, rely on maintainers and distro developers to package and
review every change on the software that they put in their archives. That is
a lot of work, and it slows down the feedback loop a lot, as we have seen. In
here we automated most of the tasks of a distro maintainer, and the new
revisions can be delivered directly to the users without any reviews. So the
users are trusting directly their upstream developers without intermediaries,
but it's very different from the previously existing and unsafe methods. The
code of snaps is installed read-only, very well constrained with access only to
their own safe space. Any other access needs to be declared by the snap, and
the user is always in control of which access is permitted to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way upstream developers can go faster but without exposing their users to
unnecessary risks. And they just need a simple snapcraft.yaml file and to define
their own continuous delivery pipeline, on their own timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing the distro as the intermediary between the developers and their
users, we are also making a new world full of possibilities for the Ubuntu
community. Now they can collaborate constantly and directly with upstream
developers, closing this quick feedback loop. In the future we will tell our
children of the good old days when we had to report a bug in Ubuntu, which
would be copied to Debian, then sent upstream to the developers, and after 6
months, the fix would arrive. It was fun, and it lead us to where we are today,
but I will not miss it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what's next for IPFS? After this experiment we got more than 200
unique testers and almost 300 test installs. I now have great confidence on
this workflow, new revisions were delivered on time, existing Ubuntu
testers became new IPFS contributors and I now can safely recommend IPFS
users to install the stable snap. But there's still plenty of work ahead.
There are still manual steps in the pipeline that can be scripted, the smoke
tests can be automated to leave more free time for exploratory testing, we can
release also to armhf and arm64 architectures to get IPFS into the
&lt;a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/internet-of-things"&gt;IoT world&lt;/a&gt;, and well, of course the
developers are not stopping, they keep releasing new interesting features. As I
said, plenty of opportunities for us as distro contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/ipfs-stats.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of the IPFS snap stats" src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/ipfs-stats.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank everybody who tested the IPFS snap, specially the following
people for their help and feedback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;freekvh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;urcminister&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carla Sella&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;casept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colin Law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ventrical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cariboo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;howefield&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to release your project to the Ubuntu store, take a look at the
&lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io/"&gt;snapcraft docs&lt;/a&gt;, the
&lt;a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, and come talk to us in
&lt;a href="https://rocket.ubuntu.com/channel/snapcraft"&gt;Rocket Chat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>free software</category><category>testing</category><category>ubuntu</category><guid>http://elopio.net/blog/ipfs-crowdtesting/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Call for testing: MySQL</title><link>http://elopio.net/blog/call-for-testing-mysql/</link><dc:creator>Leo Arias</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promised that more interesting things were going to be available soon for
testing in Ubuntu. There's plenty coming, but today here is one of the
greatest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo snap install mysql --channel&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;.0/beta
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/Screenshot_ubuntu-xenial-20170228_2017-02-28_093217.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of mysql snap running" src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/Screenshot_ubuntu-xenial-20170228_2017-02-28_093217.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lars Tangvald and other people at MySQL have been working on this snap for some
time, and now they are ready to give it to the community for crowd testing. If
you have some minutes, please give them a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/elopio/c868bc68bf8640b0b49b39aeb1fae8f5"&gt;testing guide&lt;/a&gt;
to help you getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that this should run in trusty, xenial, yakkety, zesty and in all
flavours of Ubuntu. It would be great to get a diverse pool of platforms and
test it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here we are introducing a new concept:
&lt;a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/channels"&gt;tracks&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that we are
using &lt;code&gt;--channel=8.0/beta&lt;/code&gt;, instead of only &lt;code&gt;--beta&lt;/code&gt; as we used to do before.
That's because mysql has two different major versions currently active. In order
to try the other one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo snap install mysql --channel&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;.7/beta
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please report back your results. Any kind of feedback will be highly appreciated,
and if you have doubts or need a hand to get started, I'm hanging around in
&lt;a href="https://rocket.ubuntu.com/channel/community"&gt;Rocket Chat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>free software</category><category>testing</category><category>ubuntu</category><guid>http://elopio.net/blog/call-for-testing-mysql/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:40:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Call for testing: snaps in Trusty</title><link>http://elopio.net/blog/call-for-testing-trusty-snaps/</link><dc:creator>Leo Arias</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a huge announcement coming: snaps now run in Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to note how big this is. Ubuntu 14.04 is a long-term release that
will be supported until 2019. Ubuntu 16.04 is also a long-term release that
will be supported until 2021. We have many many many users in both releases,
some of which will stay there until we drop the support. Before this snappy new
world, all those users were stuck with the versions of all their programs
released in 2014 or 2016, getting only updates for security and critical
issues. Just try to remember how your favorite program looked 5 years ago;
maybe it didn't even exist. We were used to choose between stability and cool
new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a new world is possible. With snaps you can have a stable base system
with frequent updates for every program, without the risk of breaking your
machine. And now if you are a Trusty user, you can just start taking advantage
of all this. If you are a developer, you have to prepare only one release and
it will just work in all the supported Ubuntu releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome, right? The Ubuntu devs have been doing a great job. snapd has already
landed in the Trusty archive, and we have been running many manual and
automated tests on it. So we would like now to invite the community to test it,
explore weird paths, try to break it. We will appreciate it very much, but all
of those Trusty users out there will love it, when they receive loads of new
high quality free software on their oldie machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how to get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are already running Trusty, you will just have to install snapd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo apt update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sudo apt install snapd
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reboot your system after that in case you had a kernel update pending, and to
get the paths for the new snap binaries set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running a different Ubuntu release, you can
&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/install-ubuntu-in-vm/"&gt;Install Ubuntu in a virtual machine&lt;/a&gt;.
Just make sure that you install the
&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/call-for-testing-trusty-snaps/14.04%20iso"&gt;http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have Trusty with snapd ready, try a few commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ snap list
$ sudo snap install hello-world
$ hello-world
$ snap find something
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/trusty/trusty-snaps-bigger.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of snaps running in Trusty" src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/trusty/trusty-snaps-bigger.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep searching for snaps until you find one that's interesting. Install it,
try it, and let us know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find something wrong, please
&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+filebug"&gt;report a bug&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;trusty&lt;/code&gt;
tag. If you are new to the Ubuntu community or get lost on the way, come and
join us in &lt;a href="https://rocket.ubuntu.com/channel/community"&gt;Rocket Chat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after a good session of testing, sit down, relax, and get ohmygiraffe. With
love from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/popey"&gt;popey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo snap install ohmygiraffe

Testing Days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session was pretty interesting, because after setting some of the bases
last year we are now ready to dig deep into the most important projects that
will define the future of Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about Ubuntu Core, a snap package that is the base of the operating
system. Because it is a snap, it gets the same benefits as all the other snaps:
automatic updates, rollbacks in case of error during installation, read-only
mount of the code, isolation from other snaps, multiple channels on the store
for different levels of stability, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The features, philosophy and future of Core were presented by
&lt;a href="https://mvogt.wordpress.com/"&gt;Michael Vogt&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zygoon"&gt;Zygmunt Krynicki&lt;/a&gt;, and then
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/frgnieto"&gt;Federico Giménez&lt;/a&gt; did a great demo of how to
create an image and test it in QEMU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the image below to watch the full session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBfAmCZMXQ8"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/nBfAmCZMXQ8/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of resources in the Ubuntu websites related to Ubuntu Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, we recommend to follow this guide to
&lt;a href="https://developer.ubuntu.com/core/get-started/kvm"&gt;run the operating system in a virtual machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, and if you are feeling brave and want to help Michael, Zygmund and
Federico, you can download the candidate image instead, from
&lt;a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/candidate/pending/ubuntu-core-16-amd64.img.xz"&gt;http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/candidate/pending/ubuntu-core-16-amd64.img.xz&lt;/a&gt;
This is the image that's being currently tested, so if you find something wrong
or weird, please
&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+filebug"&gt;report a bug in Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to learn more about the snaps that compose the image and
take a peek at the things that we'll cover in the following testing days, you
can follow the
&lt;a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/create-your-own-core-image#0"&gt;tutorial to create your own Core image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this session we were also accompanied by
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sdrobertw"&gt;Robert Wolff&lt;/a&gt; who works on 96boards at Linaro.
He has an awesome show every Thursday called
&lt;a href="https://www.96boards.org/openhours/"&gt;Open Hours&lt;/a&gt;. At 96boards they are
building open Linux boards for prototyping and embedded computing. Anybody can
jump into the Open Hours to learn more about this cool work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great news that Robert brought is that both Open Hours and Ubuntu Testing
Days will be focused on Ubuntu Core this month. He will be our guest again next
Friday, February 10th, where he will be talking about the
&lt;a href="http://www.96boards.org/product/dragonboard410c/"&gt;DragonBoard 410c&lt;/a&gt;. Also my
good friend &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+OliverGrawert"&gt;Oliver Grawert&lt;/a&gt; will be
with us, and he will talk about the work he has been doing to enable Ubuntu in
this board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great topics ahead, and a full new world of possiblities now that we are
mixing free software with open hardware and affordable prototyping tools.
Remember, every Friday in &lt;a href="http://ubuntuonair.com/"&gt;http://ubuntuonair.com/&lt;/a&gt;,
no se lo pierda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>free software</category><category>testing</category><category>ubuntu</category><guid>http://elopio.net/blog/ubuntu-testing-day-wrap-up-20170203/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 05:38:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Call for testing: IPFS</title><link>http://elopio.net/blog/call-for-testing-ipfs/</link><dc:creator>Leo Arias</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy new year Ubunteros and Ubunteras!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been following our testing days, you will know by now that
our intention is to get more people contributing to Ubuntu and free
software projects, and to help them getting started through testing
and related tasks. So, we will be making frequent calls for testing
where you can contribute and learn. Educational AND fun ^_^&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start the year, I would like to invite you to test the IPFS
candidate snap. IPFS is a really interesting free project for
distributed storage. You can read more about it and watch a demo in
the &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/%5D"&gt;IPFS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have pushed a nice snap with their latest stable version to the
candidate channel in the store. But before we publish it to the stable
channel we would like to get more people testing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a clean and safe environment to test following some of the
guides you'll find on the
&lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/UbuntuTestingDay"&gt;summaries of the past testing days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you want to use your current system, you can just do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo snap install ipfs --candidate
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have written a
&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/elopio/7492a28bd1aef6c4a86b5dcf5d5cb65b#smoke-tests-for-the-ipfs-snap"&gt;gist with a simple guide to get started testing it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you finish that successfully and still have more time, or are
curious about ipfs, please continue with an exploratory testing
session. The idea here is just to execute random commands, try unusual
inputs and just play around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get ideas from the &lt;a href="https://ipfs.io/docs/examples/"&gt;IPFS docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are done, please send me an email with your results and any
comments. And if you get stuck or have any kind of question, please
don't hesitate to ask. Remember that we welcome everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>free software</category><category>testing</category><category>ubuntu</category><guid>http://elopio.net/blog/call-for-testing-ipfs/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2017 15:58:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ubuntu Testing Day wrap up - snapcraft and beers (20161216)</title><link>http://elopio.net/blog/ubuntu-testing-day-wrap-up-20161216/</link><dc:creator>Leo Arias</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we had the last Ubuntu Testing Day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited &lt;a href="http://blog.sergiusens.org/"&gt;Sergio Schvezov&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeTalbott"&gt;Joe Talbott&lt;/a&gt;, to join
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rainveil"&gt;Kyle&lt;/a&gt; and myself. Together we have been working
on &lt;a href="http://snapcraft.io"&gt;Snapcraft&lt;/a&gt; the whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergio did a great introduction of snapcraft, and showed some of the new
features that will land next week in Ubuntu. And because it was the last day of
work for everybody (except Kyle), we threw some beers into the hang out and
made it our team end of year party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the full recording by clicking the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30MI-suotQ"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/S30MI-suotQ/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapcraft is one of the few projects that have an exception to land new features
into released versions of Ubuntu. So every week we are landing new things in
Xenial and Yakkety. This means that we need to constantly test that we are not
breaking anything for all the people using stable Ubuntu releases; and it means
that we would love to have many more hands helping us with those tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to help, all you have to do is
&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/install-ubuntu-in-vm/"&gt;set up a virtual machine&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/test-sru/"&gt;enable the proposed pocket&lt;/a&gt; in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the active bug for the Stable Release Update of snapcraft 2.24:
&lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapcraft/+bug/1650632"&gt;bug #1650632&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I shut down my computer and start my holidays, I would like to thank all
the Ubuntu community for one more year, it has been quite a ride. And I would
like to thank Sergio, Kyle and Joe in particular. They are the best team a QA
Engineer could ask for &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next year for more testing days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>free software</category><category>testing</category><category>ubuntu</category><guid>http://elopio.net/blog/ubuntu-testing-day-wrap-up-20161216/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2016 02:34:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Test a stable release update</title><link>http://elopio.net/blog/test-sru/</link><dc:creator>Leo Arias</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu has a six month cycle for releases. This means that we work for six months updating software, adding new features and making sure that it all works consistently together when it’s integrated into the operating system, and then we release it. Once we make a release, it is considered stable and then we almost exclusively add to that release critical bug fixes and patches for security vulnerabilities. The exceptions are just a few, and are for software that’s important for Ubuntu and that we want to keep up-to-date with the latest features even in stable releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These bug fixes, security patches and exceptional new features require a lot of testing, because right after they are published they will reach all the Ubuntu users that are in the stable release. And we want the release to remain stable, never ever introduce a regression that will make those users unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call all of them &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates"&gt;Stable Release Updates&lt;/a&gt;, and we test them in the &lt;em&gt;proposed&lt;/em&gt; pocket of the Ubuntu archive. This is obviously not enabled by default, so the brave souls that want to help us testing the changes in proposed need to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go on, I would recommend to test SRUs &lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/install-ubuntu-in-vm/"&gt;in a virtual machine&lt;/a&gt;. Once you enable proposed following this guide you will get constant and untested updates from many packages, and these updates will break parts of your system every now and then. It’s not likely to be critical, but it can bother you if it happens on the machine you need to do your work, or other stuff. And if somebody makes a mistake, you might need to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also have to find a package that needs testing. &lt;a href="http://snapcraft.io"&gt;Snapcraft&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few exceptions allowed to land in a stable release every week. So lets use it as an example. Lets say you want to help us testing the upcoming release of snapcraft in Ubuntu 16.04.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your machine ready and before enabling proposed, install the version already released of the package you want to test. This way you’ll test later an update to the newer version, just what a normal user would get once the update is approved and lands in the archive. So in a terminal, write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install snapcraft&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or replace &lt;em&gt;snapcraft&lt;/em&gt; with whatever package you are testing. If you are doing it just during the weekend after I am writing this, the released version of snapcraft will be 2.23. You can check it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ dpkg -s snapcraft | grep Version
  Version: 2.23&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to enable proposed, open the &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu Software&lt;/em&gt; application, and select &lt;em&gt;Software &amp;amp; Updates&lt;/em&gt; from the menu in the top of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/sru/1-open_sources.png"&gt; &lt;img src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/sru/1-open_sources.png" alt="image"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;Software &amp;amp; Updates&lt;/em&gt; window, select the &lt;em&gt;Developer Options&lt;/em&gt; tab. And check the item that says &lt;em&gt;Pre-released updates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/sru/2-enable_proposed.png"&gt; &lt;img src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/sru/2-enable_proposed.png" alt="image"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will prompt for your password. Enter it, and then click the &lt;em&gt;Close&lt;/em&gt; button. You will be asked if you want to reload your sources, so yes, click the &lt;em&gt;Reload&lt;/em&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/sru/3-reload.png"&gt; &lt;img src="https://archive.org/download/elopio-screenshots2/sru/3-reload.png" alt="image"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally try to upgrade. If there is a newer version available in the proposed pocket for the packet you are testing, now you will get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ sudo apt install snapcraft
  $ dpkg -s snapcraft | grep Version
  Version: 2.24&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time there is a proposed update, the package will have corresponding SRU bugs with the tag “verification-needed”. In the case of snapcraft this weekend, this is the bug for the 2.24 proposed update: &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapcraft/+bug/1650632"&gt;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapcraft/+bug/1650632&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SRU bugs will have instructions about how to test that the fix or the new features released are correct. Follow those steps, and if you are confident that they work as expected, change the tag to “verification-done”. If you find that the fix is not correct, change the tag to “verification-failed”. In case of doubt, you can leave a comment in the bug explaining what you tried and what you found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about SRUs in the &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates"&gt;Stable Release Updates wiki page&lt;/a&gt;, and also in the &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification"&gt;wiki page explaining how to perform verifications&lt;/a&gt;. This last page includes a section to find packages and bugs that need verification. If you want to help the Ubuntu community, you can just jump in and start verifying some of the pending bugs. It will be highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or find a problem, join us in the &lt;a href="https://rocket.ubuntu.com/channel/community"&gt;Ubuntu Rocket Chat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+KevinGunnCanonical"&gt;Kevin Gunn&lt;/a&gt; joined us to talk
about the Unity8 snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a thriving project with lots of things to do and bugs to uncover, so
it's the perfect candidate for newcomers eager to help Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested and didn't attend our meeting on Friday, click the image
below to watch the recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGsA55RvqLI"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt text" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/oGsA55RvqLI/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install Unity 8 in the Ubuntu 16.04
&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/pristine-vm/"&gt;cloned virtual machine&lt;/a&gt;
that we prepared on the past session, enter the following commands in the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo add-apt-repository -u ppa:ci-train-ppa-service/stable-phone-overlay
$ sudo apt install unity8-session-snap
$ unity8-snap-install
$ sudo reboot
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After reboot, on the login screen click the Ubuntu icon next to your user name
and change the selection to Unity 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin and his team have a
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-jKITqUxRsujmN3OwRj3wRnn6dgblKuvrhKjeN8-Wc/edit#heading=h.q06bivmaid8f"&gt;google doc with the instructions to build and install the snap, and the
current status&lt;/a&gt;.
If you find a bug, you can talk to the developers joining the
&lt;a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#ubuntu-touch"&gt;#ubuntu-touch IRC channel on freenode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While preparing the testing environment on this session we had a crash, and
explained how easy it is to send the report to the Ubuntu developers by just
clicking the &lt;em&gt;Report problem...&lt;/em&gt; button. The reports from all our users
are in the &lt;a href="https://errors.ubuntu.com/"&gt;error tracker&lt;/a&gt;, along with a frequency
graph and the links to bug reports where those crashes are being fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also showed two tricks to make faster and more pleasant the testing session
in a virtual machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://elopio.net/blog/setup-apt-cache/"&gt;Set up a cache for deb packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/858649/how-can-i-copypaste-from-the-host-to-a-kvm-guest"&gt;Share the clipboard between the host and the guest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/la_juyis"&gt;Julia&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rainveil"&gt;Kyle&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+KevinGunnCanonical"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; for the nice session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us again next Friday at &lt;a href="https://ubuntuonair.com"&gt;Ubuntu On-Air&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>free software</category><category>testing</category><category>ubuntu</category><guid>http://elopio.net/blog/ubuntu-testing-day-wrap-up-20161209/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2016 15:41:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Set up a cache for deb packages</title><link>http://elopio.net/blog/setup-apt-cache/</link><dc:creator>Leo Arias</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;All Linux distributions are constantly updating the versions of the packages in their archives. That’s what makes them great, lots of people working in a distributed way to let you easily update your software and get the latest features or critical bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you should constatly update your operating system. Otherwise you’ll become an easy target for criminals exploiting known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, at least for me, is that I have many many Ubuntu machines in the house and my badwidth is really bad. So keeping all my real machines, virtual machines and various devices up-to-date every day has become a slow problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to cache the downloaded deb packages. So only one machine has to make the downloads from the internet, and they will be kept in my local network to make much faster to get the packages in the other machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me introduce you to &lt;a href="https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/"&gt;Apt-Cacher NG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting it up is simple. First, choose a machine to run the cacher and store the packages. Ideally, this machine should be running all the time, and should have a good amount of storage space. I’m using my desktop as the cacher; but as soon as I update my router to one that runs Ubuntu, I will make that one the cacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that machine, install apt-cacher-ng:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  sudo apt install apt-cacher-ng&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it. The cacher is installed and configured. Now we need the name of this machine to use it on the other ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ hostname
  calchas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;em&gt;calchas&lt;/em&gt; is the name of the machine I’m using as the cacher. Take note of the name of your machine, and now, in all the other machines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  $ sudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will create a new empty configuration file for &lt;em&gt;apt&lt;/em&gt;, and open it to be edited with &lt;em&gt;gedit&lt;/em&gt;, the default graphical editor in Ubuntu. In the editor, write this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Acquire::http::proxy "http://calchas.lan:3142";&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;replacing &lt;em&gt;calchas&lt;/em&gt; with the name of your cacher machine, collected above. The &lt;em&gt;.lan&lt;/em&gt; part is really only needed when you are setting it up in a virtual machine and the host is the same as the cacher, but it doesn’t hurt to add it on real machines. That number, &lt;em&gt;3142&lt;/em&gt;, is the network port where the caching service is running, leave it unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the first time you update a package in your network it will be slow just as before. But all the other machines updating the same package will be very fast. I have to thank &lt;em&gt;apt-cacher-ng&lt;/em&gt; for saving me many hours during my updates of the past years.&lt;/p&gt;
