Today we had our first testing day. We will keep doing this every Friday, and
at the end of the session I will post a summary with links to follow up and
learn more about the subject in case somebody is interested.

For this session we had Kyle Fazzari talking about his work as the maintainer
of the Nextcloud snap.

You can find more info about the project in the
[Nextcloud main page](https://nextcloud.com/) and more info about the snap
in [Kyle's blog](https://kyrofa.com/).

We tested the snap using a virtual machine. To set one up you can use the
following guides:

 * [Download the latest Ubuntu LTS](http://elopio.net/blog/download-ubuntu/)
 * [Set up a virtual machine](http://elopio.net/blog/install-ubuntu-in-vm/)
 * [Install Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop)

After the virtual machine is ready, Nextcloud can be installed in there by just
running in the terminal:

    $ sudo snap install nextcloud

If you want to test an unreleased and unstable version to help the Nextcloud
developers, you can add the flag --edge or --beta to that command.

I wrote some steps to guide you getting started with the testing in this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/elopio/735d995920ef5fb9d24eb6931f6686c0).

And finally, if you want to join our community, we are usually in
[Rocket Chat](https://rocket.ubuntu.com/).
You can join the #community, #qa or #snapcraft channels, or any other that
catches your attention.

Special thanks to [Julia](https://twitter.com/la_juyis) and CoderEurope for joining us during the session. And of course to Kyle and the Nextcloud
community for this amazing piece of free software that encourages everybody to
take control over their data, in a really simple way.

You are all invited to join us the next time, which will be Friday, December
2nd, again at [Ubuntu On-Air](https://ubuntuonair.com). The time and theme will be announced
soon. Or at least before it starts.
