\title{There is no God}

\begin{document}

\begin{verse}
  I was an infant when my mother went \\
  To see an atheist burned. She took me there: \\
  The dark-robed priests were met around the pile; \\
  The multitude was gazing silently; \\
  And as the culprit passed with dauntless mien, \\
  Tempered disdain in his unaltering eye, \\
  Mixed with a quiet smile, shone calmly forth: \\
  The thirsty fire crept round his manly limbs; \\
  His resolute eyes were scorched to blindness, soon; \\
  His death-pang rent my heart! the insensate mob \\
  Uttered a cry of triumph, and I wept. \\
  "Weep not, child!" cried my mother, "for that man \\
  Has said, 'There is no God.'" \\
\end{verse}
